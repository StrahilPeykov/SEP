## Overview

CarbonInsight helps companies track, calculate, and reduce their carbon footprint across complex supply chains. Built for SMEs who need accessible tools for Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) calculations and Digital Product Passport (DPP) creation using open standards like Asset Administration Shell (AAS).

## Features

- **Supply Chain Emissions Tracking**: Track carbon emissions across complex product Bill of Materials (BoM)
- **Multiple Emission Types**: Support for transport, production energy, and user energy emissions
- **Standards Compliance**: Export to Asset Administration Shell (AAS) formats (AASX, XML, JSON)
- **SCSN Integration**: Export Product Carbon Footprint data in SCSN XML format
- **Company & Product Management**: Multi-tenant architecture with company-based product ownership
- **Data Sharing**: Request and approve access to supplier emission data
- **Import/Export**: Bulk import/export via CSV, XLSX, and standardized formats
- **AI Recommendations**: OpenAI-powered suggestions for emission reduction
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail of all changes
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with rate limiting

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Django 5.0, Django REST Framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (production), SQLite (development)
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with SimpleJWT
- **Standards**: AAS (Asset Administration Shell), SCSN (Smart Connected Supplier Network)
- **AI**: OpenAI integration for recommendations
- **Deployment**: Railway.app, Vercel compatible

## Architecture

### Core Models

- **Company**: Organizations that own products and manage users
- **Product**: Items with associated emissions and Bill of Materials
- **Emission**: Abstract base for different emission types:
  - `TransportEmission`: Shipping and logistics emissions
  - `ProductionEnergyEmission`: Manufacturing energy consumption
  - `UserEnergyEmission`: End-user energy consumption
- **ProductBoMLineItem**: Bill of Materials relationships between products
- **ProductSharingRequest**: Mechanism for requesting access to supplier emission data

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- PostgreSQL (for production) or SQLite (for development)
- pip for package management

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/StrahilPeykov/carboninsight-backend.git
